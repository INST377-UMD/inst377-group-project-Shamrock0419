Name: Food Facts
Description: In response to the growing need for transparent and comprehensive information on food products, we propose the development of the Food Facts Platform(FFP). The goal of the FFP is to empower individuals to make informed dietary choices by providing a centralized and accessible source of detailed information regarding to food products they are putting into their system. The FFP aims to go beyond the limitations of tradiitonal nutrition labels, by offering a hollistic view including not only nutritional facts, but also all the ingredients and where they were originated, allergens, consumer-relevant labels, and environment impact metrics, such as carbon footprint.
